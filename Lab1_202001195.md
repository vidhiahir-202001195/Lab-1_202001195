### Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

### Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs.

#### Library Information System


##### Functional Requirements of LIS:
In the given case study the tasks that we need to attain in Library Information System(LIS) are:
- LIS should be enabled to use by each user from any place rather than only one device at the library, hence we need to give access to the students and employees for making request at LIS.
- If one of the users wants to extend his/her borrowing period then the system will check whether the same book's new entry for the next dates in which the user wants to extend the borrowing period is made by another user or not, if not then the system will allow the user to extend borrowing period.
- This system's data should be easily available and editable to library staff.
- The exclusive access should be given to librarian who can add or remove book from the system in case of new purchase of book or removal of any book.
- Any person should be able to read the book from this system online, but only the employees and students are allowed to isuue the book from this system.
-If the user searches for the book then it should show the books that are currently available in the LIS, if not then it should show that the book is not available.
-For advanced use, the system can also store the searches that are not available in LIS , later on the librarian can add on the most searched but not available book in the library.



##### Non-Functional Requirements of LIS:
- Speed : The user should get the result of his/her search within 0.1 second.
- Security : This system should be strong enough to bare any malware attack which can cause extreme damage.The system should only be able to run on Institute LAN.
- Consistency : The system should give the same result to different users with same searches.eg, if one user has searched for the book and the system shows it is not available then if another user searches for that same book then it should give the same result as the first one.Through out its life span the system should remain consistent.
- Compatibility : The system should be able to provide good service to multiple user at the same time.
- Portability : the software shopuld run on different nOS and different version of any OSD with minimal changes.
- Usability : The users should be able to easily understand how to use this LIS.


### Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects

Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

##### Scope:
- This application ois aimed at  5% of the world population suffers from disabling hearing loss.
- It will detect one of the known sounds for eg, car horns and babies sound where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user, and will prompt the user by vibrating the phone.
- This application will use artificial intelligence for sensing the sounds.
- It will detect the sound within the radius of 100 m.

##### Features:
- This application will detect the sound of incidents by comparing it with by default audios in application.
- Then if it detects that sound it will give long vibration which is not same as the notification vibration.
- This alert will warn the user and he/she can stop immediately after feeling that vibration.
- This application detects the sound within 100 m of radius.
- This will also show that how far is the user from the source of the sound.
- Hence he/she can be alert well in advance.

##### Non-functional Aspect:
- Instant response: The user shouold get immediate response from the application after the actual sound is detected.
- Usability : Since the user is not able to hear properly, the usability of the application should mainly depend on the visible apects of the application and user should easily understand the functionality.
-Portability : The application should run on different OS eg android,Iphone.
- Consistency : The audio records should be consictently stored in phon'e memory and get updated by adding new alerting noise throughout its lifespan.
- Compatibility : The application should run smoothly even though the multiple voices get detected at the same time.
